# Workflows Collection

## Overview

The Workflows collection provides pre-defined, reusable workflow patterns for common multi-agent system operations and complex task orchestration.

## Workflow Categories

### Development Workflows
- Feature development
- Bug fixing
- Code review
- Testing cycles
- Deployment pipelines

### Analysis Workflows
- Code quality assessment
- Security scanning
- Performance profiling
- Dependency analysis
- Technical debt evaluation

### Automation Workflows
- CI/CD pipelines
- Scheduled tasks
- Event-driven processes
- Self-healing operations
- Auto-scaling procedures

## Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: workflow-name
description: Workflow purpose
triggers:
  - manual
  - schedule
  - event
steps:
  - name: step1
    agent: agent-type
    action: action-name
    inputs: 
      key: value
  - name: step2
    depends_on: step1
    parallel: true
    agents:
      - agent1
      - agent2
outputs:
  - result1
  - result2
```

## Example Workflows

### Code Review Workflow
```yaml
name: comprehensive-code-review
steps:
  1. Static analysis
  2. Security scan
  3. Performance check
  4. Documentation review
  5. Generate report
```

### Deployment Workflow
```yaml
name: production-deployment
steps:
  1. Run tests
  2. Build artifacts
  3. Deploy to staging
  4. Run smoke tests
  5. Deploy to production
  6. Monitor metrics
```

## Best Practices

- Keep workflows atomic
- Use version control
- Document dependencies
- Handle failures gracefully
- Monitor execution
- Optimize performance
