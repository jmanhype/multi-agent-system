# Tests Directory

## Overview

The Tests directory contains comprehensive test suites for the multi-agent system, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for all components.

## Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/              # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/       # Integration tests for agent interactions
├── e2e/              # End-to-end workflow tests
├── performance/      # Performance benchmarks
├── security/         # Security test suites
└── fixtures/         # Test data and mocks
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Agent functionality
- Command execution
- Hook validation
- Memory operations
- Utility functions

### Integration Tests
- Agent coordination
- Swarm operations
- MCP integration
- Workflow execution
- Cross-agent communication

### E2E Tests
- Complete workflows
- User scenarios
- Production simulations
- Failure recovery
- Scale testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- tests/unit
npm test -- tests/integration
npm test -- tests/e2e

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## Test Frameworks

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing
- **Pytest**: Python testing
- **Mocha/Chai**: Node.js testing
- **Cypress**: E2E testing
- **K6**: Performance testing

## Test Standards

### Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests: > 80%
- Integration tests: > 70%
- E2E tests: Critical paths
- Overall: > 75%

### Test Naming
```javascript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should perform expected behavior when condition', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Best Practices

- Write tests before code (TDD)
- Keep tests isolated
- Use meaningful assertions
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases
- Maintain test data
- Regular test review
