# Commands Collection

## Overview

The Commands collection provides reusable command patterns, automation scripts, and workflow definitions for common multi-agent system operations.

## Command Categories

### Agent Commands (`agents/`)
- Agent spawning and management
- Capability matching
- Coordination protocols
- Type definitions

### Analysis Commands (`analysis/`)
- Performance reporting
- Bottleneck detection
- Token usage analysis
- Metrics collection

### Automation Commands (`automation/`)
- Auto-agent spawning
- Smart workflow selection
- Intelligent automation
- Self-organizing systems

### Coordination Commands (`coordination/`)
- Swarm initialization
- Task orchestration
- Agent synchronization
- Load balancing

### GitHub Commands (`github/`)
- Repository analysis
- PR management
- Issue tracking
- Code review automation

### Hive-Mind Commands (`hive-mind/`)
- Collective initialization
- Consensus building
- Memory synchronization
- Session management

### Monitoring Commands (`monitoring/`)
- Real-time monitoring
- Metrics collection
- Performance tracking
- Health checks

### Swarm Commands (`swarm/`)
- Swarm initialization
- Topology management
- Strategy selection
- Background operations

## Command Structure

```bash
# Command template
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Command purpose
# Usage: command-name [options] [arguments]
# Dependencies: required-tools

function main() {
    # Command implementation
}

main "$@"
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Initialize swarm
./commands/swarm/swarm-init.sh --topology mesh --agents 5

# Spawn specialized agent
./commands/agents/agent-spawn.sh --type analyzer --capability security

# Run performance analysis
./commands/analysis/performance-report.sh --format detailed
```

## Best Practices

- Keep commands modular
- Use consistent naming
- Document parameters
- Handle errors gracefully
- Log command execution
- Support dry-run mode
