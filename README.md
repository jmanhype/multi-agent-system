# Multi-Agent System Framework

A comprehensive AI agent orchestration framework with advanced performance monitoring, automated hooks, and distributed consensus mechanisms for coordinating specialized AI agents on complex software engineering tasks.

## 🚀 Overview

This framework provides a complete ecosystem for AI agent swarms with real-time metrics collection, automated CI/CD hooks, Byzantine fault tolerance, and sophisticated coordination patterns. It includes performance monitoring, automated testing hooks, and distributed consensus protocols.

## ✨ Key Features

### Agent Orchestration & Performance
- **Swarm Topologies**: Hierarchical, mesh, ring, and star configurations with adaptive coordination
- **Performance Monitor Agent**: Real-time metrics collection, SLA monitoring, anomaly detection
- **Resource Tracking**: Multi-dimensional metrics for system, agent, coordination, and task execution
- **Dynamic Scaling & Load Balancing**: Automatic topology optimization based on workload
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Raft, Byzantine fault tolerance, CRDT synchronization, Gossip protocols

### Automated Hooks & CI/CD
- **Pre-run Hooks**: Automatic linting, type checking, and unit testing for Python, Node.js, Rust, and Elixir projects
- **Post-run Hooks**: Execution analysis and review generation
- **Verification Gates**: Truth score verification and security checks
- **Hook Logging**: Comprehensive JSON logs for chat, tool use (pre/post), and agent lifecycle events

### Specialized Agent Types

#### Core Agents
- **Planner**: Strategic planning and task breakdown
- **Researcher**: Information gathering and analysis  
- **Coder**: Implementation and code generation
- **Tester**: Testing with production validation
- **Reviewer**: Multi-perspective code review

#### Performance & Optimization Agents
- **Performance Monitor**: Real-time metrics, bottleneck analysis, SLA monitoring
- **Performance Benchmarker**: Consensus performance testing
- **Load Balancer**: Dynamic resource distribution
- **Topology Optimizer**: Swarm configuration optimization
- **Resource Allocator**: Intelligent resource management

#### Consensus & Coordination Agents
- **Byzantine Coordinator**: Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus
- **Raft Manager**: Raft consensus protocol implementation
- **CRDT Synchronizer**: Conflict-free replicated data types
- **Gossip Coordinator**: Gossip protocol for distributed systems
- **Quorum Manager**: Quorum-based decision making
- **Security Manager**: Consensus security protocols

#### GitHub Integration Agents
- **PR Manager**: Pull request automation
- **Issue Tracker**: Intelligent issue management
- **Release Manager & Coordinator**: Release automation
- **Code Review Swarm**: Distributed code review
- **Multi-Repo Swarm**: Cross-repository coordination
- **Workflow Automation**: GitHub Actions integration

#### Advanced Capabilities
- **Hive Mind**: Distributed intelligence with shared memory, consensus mechanisms, and session management
- **SPARC Methodology**: Complete SPARC implementation (Specification → Pseudocode → Architecture → Refinement → Code)
- **Adaptive Coordinator**: Dynamic strategy adjustment based on performance metrics
- **Memory Persistence**: Cross-session knowledge retention with memory stores

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmanhype/multi-agent-system.git
cd multi-agent-system
```

2. Initialize MCP servers:
```bash
./init-mcp.sh
```

3. Configure your environment:
```bash
cp settings.json settings.local.json
# Edit settings.local.json with your configuration
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Initialize a Swarm
```bash
# Create a hierarchical swarm with 5 agents
./helpers/quick-start.sh
```

### Spawn Specialized Agents
```javascript
// Example: Spawn a code review swarm
{
  "command": "swarm-init",
  "topology": "hierarchical",
  "agents": ["reviewer", "tester", "analyzer"]
}
```

### Execute a Task
```javascript
// Orchestrate a complex task across the swarm
{
  "command": "task-orchestrate",
  "task": "Refactor authentication module",
  "strategy": "parallel"
}
```

## 📚 Use Cases

### Automated Code Review
Deploy a swarm of specialized reviewers to analyze code from multiple perspectives:
- Security analysis
- Performance optimization
- Code quality assessment
- Best practices validation

### Complex Problem Solving
Break down complex problems and distribute them across expert agents:
- Research agents gather information
- Architects design solutions
- Coders implement features
- Testers validate results

### CI/CD Automation
Integrate with GitHub for automated workflows:
- PR review and enhancement
- Issue triage and assignment
- Release coordination
- Multi-repo synchronization
