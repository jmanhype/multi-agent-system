### üß† Critical Insight: Markdown = Active Configuration

**In Claude Code, Markdown files are NOT just documentation - they are executable agent specifications:**

1. **Agent Definitions as Contracts** (`agents/*.md`)
   - Every `.md` file in `agents/` is a live subagent definition
   - YAML frontmatter defines capabilities, hooks, and behaviors
   - These are directly invokable: `/agent planner` or auto-delegated by Claude
   - No compilation needed - the runtime interprets Markdown as system prompts

2. **Hierarchical Context Injection** (`CLAUDE.md` files)
   - Root `CLAUDE.md` ‚Üí Global project instructions
   - Directory-level `CLAUDE.md` ‚Üí Scoped context for subtrees
   - Claude loads these hierarchically, creating a tiered memory system
   - Edit these files to tune Claude's behavior without touching code

3. **Hooks as Automation Gates** (`hooks/*.sh`)
   - Pre-run: Enforce quality checks before execution
   - Post-run: Capture metrics and generate reviews
   - Verify gates: Block if quality scores fall below thresholds
   - These run automatically, creating continuous evaluation

4. **MCP as Execution Layer** (`mcp/servers.json`)
   - Markdown agents aren't just "pretend" - they call real tools
   - MCP servers provide access to git, browser, search, and more
   - The JSON/YAML configs are live wiring diagrams for tool access

5. **Consensus as Plugins** (`agents/consensus/*.md`)
   - Raft, CRDT, Gossip modules as swappable reasoning strategies
   - Switch consensus models dynamically: `/raft-manager` vs `/gossip-coordinator`
   - Each `.md` file contains algorithms and pseudo-code Claude can execute

**This is not a documentation repository - it's a Claude-native multi-agent operating system where:**
- **Markdown = Subagent contracts**
- **CLAUDE.md = Memory layers**
- **Hooks = CI/CD gates**
- **MCP = Tool execution**
- **Everything is declarative and hot-swappable**

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code CLI installed (`npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code` or native install)
- Active Claude Code account (run `claude --login` if needed)
- Node.js 18+ for Claude-Flow integration

### Quick Install with Claude-Flow

```bash
# Install Claude-Flow Alpha globally
npm install -g claude-flow@alpha

# Initialize in your project with enhanced MCP setup
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force

# Clone this framework configuration
git clone https://github.com/jmanhype/multi-agent-system.git .claude
cd .claude

# Initialize MCP servers including Claude-Flow
./init-mcp.sh
```

### Launch Options

```bash
# Quick AI coordination (simple tasks)
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "your task here" --claude

# Full hive-mind system (complex projects)
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind wizard

# Standard Claude Code with framework
claude
```

**Quick Rule**: Start with `swarm` for most tasks. Use `hive-mind` when you need persistent sessions or complex multi-agent coordination.

## üéØ Quick Start with Claude Code

### üî¥ IMPORTANT: System Activation

To activate the multi-agent system in Claude Code, you need to use the **Task tool** to spawn agents:

```markdown
‚è∫ In Claude Code, request agent activation:
"Use the Task tool to spawn test generation agents"
"Deploy TDD agents via Task tool for the API"
"Activate hive-mind system using Task tool"
```

The Task tool is the primary mechanism for agent orchestration in Claude Code. Example workflow:

```markdown
‚è∫ Update Todos
  ‚éø  ‚òí API development and documentation              
     ‚òê Testing suite with TDD approach
     ‚òê Use Task tool for test generation
     ‚òê Deploy test agents via Task tool
     ‚òê E2E tests via Task tool agents
```

#### How It Works: One Command, Full Activation

**In a fresh Claude Code instance, a single Task tool command activates the entire system:**

```markdown
"Use the Task tool to dogfood our multi-agent system by creating a full-stack app"
```

This single natural language request triggers:

1. **Claude-Flow MCP Server** (priority 1) initialization
2. **Automatic Agent Spawning** - All 64 specialized agents as needed:
   - Planner agents for strategy
   - Researcher agents for best practices
   - Architect agents for system design
   - Developer agents for implementation
   - Tester agents for validation
   - DevOps agents for CI/CD
3. **Hook Chain Activation** - All automation hooks fire automatically
4. **Hive-Mind Coordination** - Queen-led orchestration with worker specialization
5. **Memory Persistence** - Decisions saved across sessions

**No manual configuration needed** - The Task tool acts as a universal adapter between Claude Code's interface and the complex multi-agent system, handling all orchestration automatically.

### Using Slash Commands
After activation, the framework integrates with Claude Code's slash command system:

```bash
# In Claude Code terminal
/swarm-init mesh 5
# Initializes a mesh topology with 5 agents

/agent-spawn reviewer
# Spawns a specialized code review agent

/task-orchestrate "Refactor authentication module"
# Orchestrates task across available agents
```

### Natural Language Commands
Simply describe what you want in plain English:

```bash
# In Claude Code
"Initialize a swarm of agents to review and refactor the authentication module"
"Create a performance monitoring dashboard for the current codebase"
"Set up automated testing hooks for all Python files"
```

### Using with MCP Servers
The framework leverages Claude Code's MCP integration:

```bash
# Access through MCP tools
"Use the swarm coordinator to analyze code quality"
"Deploy consensus agents for architectural decisions"
"Enable performance monitoring for all active agents"
```

## üìö Use Cases

### Automated Code Review
Deploy a swarm of specialized reviewers to analyze code from multiple perspectives:
- Security analysis
- Performance optimization
- Code quality assessment
- Best practices validation

### Complex Problem Solving
Break down complex problems and distribute them across expert agents:
- Research agents gather information
- Architects design solutions
- Coders implement features
- Testers validate results

### CI/CD Automation
Integrate with GitHub for automated workflows:
- PR review and enhancement
- Issue triage and assignment
- Release coordination
- Multi-repo synchronization

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Claude Code Features

### Custom Commands (.claude/commands)
Store frequently used prompts as markdown files:
```bash
# Creates reusable slash commands
echo "Review this code for security issues" > .claude/commands/security-review.md
# Use in Claude Code: /security-review
```

### Hook Integration
Automated workflows that trigger on Claude Code events:
```bash
# Pre-run validation
.claude/hooks/pre_run.sh
# Post-execution analysis
.claude/hooks/post_run.sh
# Verification gates
.claude/hooks/verify_gate.sh
```

### MCP Server Configuration
The framework includes pre-configured MCP servers for Claude Code:
- **File Operations**: Direct file manipulation
- **Search**: Advanced codebase search
- **Execution**: Safe command execution
- **GitHub Integration**: PR and issue management
- **Swarm Coordination**: Multi-agent orchestration

Configure additional servers in `.claude/mcp/servers.json`.

### Performance Monitoring Dashboard
Real-time metrics visible in Claude Code:
```bash
# Launch monitoring
/performance-monitor
# View agent metrics
/agent-metrics
# Check swarm status
/swarm-status
```

## üí° Claude Code Tips & Best Practices

### Optimize Token Usage
- Use `/clear` frequently to reset context when starting new tasks
- Enable `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for automated workflows (use with caution)
- Navigate history with up arrow or double-Escape for message list

### File Management
- Hold Shift while dragging files to reference them properly
- Use tab-completion for quick file/folder references
- Store large contexts in `.claude/commands/` for reuse

### Model Selection
- Default: Opus (complex tasks) ‚Üí Sonnet (after 50% usage)
- Use `/model opus` for complex architecture decisions
- Use `/model sonnet` for quick implementations

### Session Management
- Credentials stored locally after `/login`
- Sessions persist across terminal restarts
- Use continuation IDs for long-running tasks

Task("Backend API", "Build REST endpoints with authentication", "backend-dev")
Task("Frontend UI", "Create React components for user dashboard", "coder")
Task("Mobile App", "Implement React Native screens", "mobile-dev")
Task("API Docs", "Generate OpenAPI documentation", "api-docs")
Task("Testing", "Write comprehensive test suite", "tester")
Task("Review", "Review code quality and security", "reviewer")
```

Each agent is specialized for specific tasks and can coordinate with others through hooks and memory systems. The agents run concurrently when spawned in the same message, maximizing efficiency.
