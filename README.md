## üîß Installation & Setup for Claude Code

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code CLI installed (`npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code` or native install)
- Active Claude Code account (run `claude --login` if needed)
- Git repository initialized

### Setup Steps

1. Clone this framework into your `.claude` directory:
```bash
# In your project root
git clone https://github.com/jmanhype/multi-agent-system.git .claude
cd .claude
```

2. Initialize MCP servers for Claude Code:
```bash
./init-mcp.sh
# This configures MCP servers for file operations, search, and integrations
```

3. Configure Claude Code settings:
```bash
cp settings.json settings.local.json
# Edit settings.local.json with your preferences
```

4. Launch Claude Code with the framework:
```bash
# From your project root
claude
# The framework is now available through slash commands
```

## üéØ Quick Start with Claude Code

### Using Slash Commands
The framework integrates with Claude Code's slash command system:

```bash
# In Claude Code terminal
/swarm-init mesh 5
# Initializes a mesh topology with 5 agents

/agent-spawn reviewer
# Spawns a specialized code review agent

/task-orchestrate "Refactor authentication module"
# Orchestrates task across available agents
```

### Natural Language Commands
Simply describe what you want in plain English:

```bash
# In Claude Code
"Initialize a swarm of agents to review and refactor the authentication module"
"Create a performance monitoring dashboard for the current codebase"
"Set up automated testing hooks for all Python files"
```

### Using with MCP Servers
The framework leverages Claude Code's MCP integration:

```bash
# Access through MCP tools
"Use the swarm coordinator to analyze code quality"
"Deploy consensus agents for architectural decisions"
"Enable performance monitoring for all active agents"
```

## üìö Use Cases

### Automated Code Review
Deploy a swarm of specialized reviewers to analyze code from multiple perspectives:
- Security analysis
- Performance optimization
- Code quality assessment
- Best practices validation

### Complex Problem Solving
Break down complex problems and distribute them across expert agents:
- Research agents gather information
- Architects design solutions
- Coders implement features
- Testers validate results

### CI/CD Automation
Integrate with GitHub for automated workflows:
- PR review and enhancement
- Issue triage and assignment
- Release coordination
- Multi-repo synchronization

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Claude Code Features

### Custom Commands (.claude/commands)
Store frequently used prompts as markdown files:
```bash
# Creates reusable slash commands
echo "Review this code for security issues" > .claude/commands/security-review.md
# Use in Claude Code: /security-review
```

### Hook Integration
Automated workflows that trigger on Claude Code events:
```bash
# Pre-run validation
.claude/hooks/pre_run.sh
# Post-execution analysis
.claude/hooks/post_run.sh
# Verification gates
.claude/hooks/verify_gate.sh
```

### MCP Server Configuration

- **File Operations**: Direct file manipulation
- **Search**: Advanced codebase search
- **Execution**: Safe command execution
- **GitHub Integration**: PR and issue management
- **Swarm Coordination**: Multi-agent orchestration

Configure additional servers in `.claude/mcp/servers.json`.

### Performance Monitoring Dashboard
Real-time metrics visible in Claude Code:
```bash
# Launch monitoring
/performance-monitor
# View agent metrics
/agent-metrics
# Check swarm status
/swarm-status
```

## üí° Claude Code Tips & Best Practices

### Optimize Token Usage
- Use `/clear` frequently to reset context when starting new tasks
- Enable `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for automated workflows (use with caution)
- Navigate history with up arrow or double-Escape for message list

### File Management
- Hold Shift while dragging files to reference them properly
- Use tab-completion for quick file/folder references
- Store large contexts in `.claude/commands/` for reuse

### Model Selection
- Default: Opus (complex tasks) ‚Üí Sonnet (after 50% usage)
- Use `/model opus` for complex architecture decisions
- Use `/model sonnet` for quick implementations

### Session Management
- Credentials stored locally after `/login`
- Sessions persist across terminal restarts
- Use continuation IDs for long-running tasks
