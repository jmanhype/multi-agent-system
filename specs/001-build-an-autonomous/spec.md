# Feature Specification: Autonomous DataAgent for Natural Language Data Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-autonomous`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an autonomous DataAgent that turns natural language data analysis requests into end-to-end workflows. The agent must accept intents like "Analyze Q1 2021 Arizona sales; trends + charts" and autonomously decompose tasks, generate SQL/Pandas operations, create visualizations, and return artifacts (tables, charts, reports) with full audit trails. The agent implements a Planner‚ÜíActor loop with perception, planning, grounding, execution, and memory phases. It must support multiple data sources (SQL databases, CSV files), enforce safety guardrails (no DDL/DROP, parameterized queries, PII blocking), use tool-based execution only (no arbitrary code), and maintain Merkle-chained audit logs. The agent should handle grounding errors through self-repair (up to K retries), store successful recipes in long-term memory keyed by schema fingerprints, and integrate with the GEPA trading system as a black-box module exposing stable JSON Request‚ÜíResponse contracts."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: When the DataAgent encounters grounding errors (invalid SQL, type mismatches), how many self-repair attempts should it make before giving up? ‚Üí A: K=3 attempts (two retries after initial failure)
- Q: For typical data analysis requests (like "Analyze Q1 2021 Arizona sales; trends + charts"), what is the acceptable completion time? ‚Üí A: Under 30 seconds (interactive response)
- Q: How should the system handle multiple simultaneous analysis requests? ‚Üí A: Hybrid: queue requests, process in parallel up to global capacity

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a quantitative researcher or trader, I want to analyze market data using natural language commands so that I can quickly gain insights without writing code manually. I should be able to request analysis like "Show me Q1 2021 Arizona sales trends with charts" and receive comprehensive results including visualizations, aggregated data, and summary reports with full transparency into what operations were performed.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user provides the intent "Analyze Q1 2021 Arizona sales; trends + charts"
   **When** the DataAgent processes this request
   **Then** the system returns monthly sales aggregates, a trend chart, a summary report, and a complete audit log of all operations performed

2. **Given** multiple data sources are available (SQL database and CSV files)
   **When** the user requests analysis spanning both sources
   **Then** the system automatically identifies relevant sources, joins data appropriately, and produces unified results

3. **Given** the user's request contains ambiguous time ranges or missing filters
   **When** the DataAgent attempts to plan the analysis
   **Then** the system identifies the ambiguity and either uses reasonable defaults (with explicit documentation) or requests clarification

4. **Given** an analysis step fails (e.g., incorrect SQL syntax)
   **When** the system encounters the error
   **Then** the DataAgent automatically attempts to repair the query (up to configured retry limit) and logs each attempt with the error details

5. **Given** a similar analysis request has been successfully completed before
   **When** the user submits a new request with the same data schema
   **Then** the system retrieves the successful recipe from long-term memory and adapts it to the new request parameters

6. **Given** a request attempts to access sensitive data or perform unsafe operations
   **When** the safety guardrails evaluate the planned operations
   **Then** the system blocks the request and returns a clear explanation of why it was denied

### Edge Cases

- What happens when requested data sources are unavailable or credentials are invalid?
  ‚Üí System should fail gracefully with clear error message and audit log entry

- How does system handle queries that would return extremely large result sets?
  ‚Üí System enforces row limits and provides warnings if results are truncated

- What happens when chart generation fails but data aggregation succeeds?
  ‚Üí System returns partial results with clear indication of what succeeded and what failed

- How does system handle malformed natural language requests?
  ‚Üí System attempts to parse intent but marks ambiguities clearly in audit log and may request clarification

- What happens when self-repair exceeds retry limit?
  ‚Üí System returns failure with all attempted approaches documented in audit log

- How does system handle concurrent requests?
  ‚Üí System uses hybrid approach: incoming requests are queued, then processed in parallel up to global resource capacity limits (CPU, memory, database connections)
